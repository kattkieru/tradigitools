tradigiTOOLS for Cinema 4D
Copyright 2011-2013 FUNHouse Interactive.

This tool was completely written by Bret Bays.  The code is all in Python.  It should run on Cinema 4D versions R13 through R15.

It was meant to become a commercial product after the addition of licensing, but for various reasons that never happened.  In its current state it is a working and useful tool for animators in Cinema 4D, and as such we've decided to also release it to the public.

Installation Instructions:

* Launch CINEMA 4D
* Choose Edit > Preferences
* In the Preferences Window click the "Open Preferences Folder" button at the bottom
* This will bring up a window. Choose "Plugins" from this window
* Copy the tradigiTOOLs folder into the plugins folder.  (This is the folder that contains the tradigiTOOLs.pyp file and its Res folder.)
* Restart CINEMA
* Access the plugin from the Plugin Menu
